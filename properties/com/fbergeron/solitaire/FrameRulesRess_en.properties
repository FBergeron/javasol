The hidden ones will be revealed automatically when freed.  To free such a card, the player needs to remove all cards stacked upon it.\n\nTo play a card on the top card of any of the 7 temporary stacks, the card must be:\n\n- revealed;\n- of a different color from the top card of the stack;\n- of one unit value lesser than the top card.\n\nSo, it's valid to play the 6 of spade or the 6 of club on the temporary stack which its top card is either the 7 of heart or the 7 of diamond.\n\nIt's also valid to play a king of any suit on an empty temporary stack.\n\nTo play a card on the top card of one of the 4 accumulation stacks, it must be :\n\n- revealed;\n- of the same suit of the top card;\n- of one unit value bigger than the top card.\n\nSo, it's valid to play the 4 of heart on the accumulation stack which its top card is the 3 of heart.\n\nIt's also valid to play whatever ace of any suit on an empty accumulation stack.\n\nThe player can get other cards to play by clicking on the deck.  3 cards will be revealed and stacked beside the deck.  The player is free to play these cards.  When all the cards from the deck has been revealed, they will come back in the deck and can be used again as long as the deck is not empty.\n\nThe game is over when either the 4 accumulation stacks are completed or there are no more valid moves to play.\n\nTo begin a new game, select the New game item in the Options menu.
