Remove the _ prefix for private variables everywhere.  Rename ClassicCard.is_isLegal() and ClassicCard.set_isLegal() accordingly.
Instead of prompting user to select game level, I think a radiobutton menuitem would be better.
Centralize the credit info (from the Game Info menuitem) into the FrameAbout.  
Implement keyboard accelerators for other functions.
Probably remove bin/backupRepository.sh.
Probably remove bin/release.sh and bin/upload.sh.
Release version 1.3.
