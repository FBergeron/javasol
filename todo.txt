Instead of prompting user to select game level, I think a radiobutton menuitem would be better.
Centralize the credit info (from the Game Info menuitem) into the FrameAbout.  
Implement keyboard accelerators for other functions.
Probably remove bin/backupRepository.sh.
Probably remove bin/release.sh and bin/upload.sh.
Fixed images from www that have been corrupted (when moving from CVS to SVN probably).
Update www.
Release version 1.3.
