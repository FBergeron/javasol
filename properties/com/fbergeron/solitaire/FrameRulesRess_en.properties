Rules01=GOAL OF THE GAME\n================\nBuild 4 stacks of cards, one for each suit, in an ascending sequential order, i.e., ace of heart, two of heart, three of heart, ..., ten of heart, jack of heart, queen of heart, and king of heart.\n\nRULES OF THE GAME\n=================\nThe layout of the cards is composed of :\n\n- 7 temporary stacks;\n- 4 stacks of accumulation;\n- and the deck of cards divided in 2 stacks.\n\nThe 7 temporary stacks may contain hidden or revealed cards.  The hidden ones will be revealed automatically when freed.  To free such a card, the player needs to remove all cards stacked upon it.\n\nTo play a card on the top card of any of the 7 temporary stacks, the card must be:\n\n- revealed;\n- of a different color from the top card of the stack;\n- of one unit value lesser than the top card.\n\nSo, it's valid to play the 6 of spade or the 6 of club on the temporary stack which its top card is either the 7 of heart or the 7 of diamond.\n\nIt's also valid to play a king of any suit on an empty temporary stack.\n\nTo play a card on the top card of one of the 4 accumulation stacks, it must be :\n\n- revealed;\n- of the same suit of the top card;\n- of one unit value bigger than the top card.\n\nSo, it's valid to play the 4 of heart on the accumulation stack which its top card is the 3 of heart.\n\nIt's also valid to play whatever ace of any suit on an empty accumulation stack.\n\nThe player can get other cards to play by clicking on the deck.  3 cards will be revealed and stacked beside the deck.  The player is free to play these cards.  When all the cards from the deck has been revealed, they will come back in the deck and can be used again as long as the deck is not empty.\n\nThe game is over when either the 4 accumulation stacks are completed or there are no more valid moves to play.\n\nTo begin a new game, select the New game item in the Options menu. It's also possible to restart a game selecting the corresponding item in the same menu.\n\n4 levels of difficulty are available: Easy, Normal, Hard, and Tricky.  Games from these levels are guaranteed to have a solution. By default, games are random and can be of any difficulty level and are not even guaranteed to have a solution. The level of the current game is shown on the left side at the bottom of the screen.  The number between parenthesis is the seed used to generate the game.\n\nTo cancel a move, select the Undo item of the Options menu.  When the Hint item of the ? menu is enabled, cards that can be played will be highlighted.\n
